# Bakery Sales Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of sales for a local bakery from January 2023 to December 2024.

## About
A local bakery approached me to analyze product sales. The owner wanted to learn more about customer's buying patterns to improve sales.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:

- TransactionNo - A unique identifier for each transaction.
- Items - The name of the purchased item.
- DateTime - The date and time of the transaction.
- Daypart - The time of day when the purchase was made (e.g., Morning).
- DayType - Indicates whether the transaction occurred on a weekday or weekend.

## Conclusions

🍪 **1. Co-Purchase Heatmap**

- At the top, we have a Co-Purchase Heatmap. This shows which items are frequently bought together. The darker the color, the stronger the pairing.
- Tea and Cake, Coffee and Brownie, Pastry and Coffee are among the most common combos.

This is a great opportunity to create combo deals or bundle promotions to boost sales.

📊 **2. Top 10 Items by Sales**

Here, you can see the best-selling products:
- Coffee and Bread are the top performers, followed by Tea, Cake, and Pastry.
- This section helps you identify which products to highlight in-store or feature in promotions.

⏰ **3. Sales by Hours**

This graph shows sales volume by hour of the day:

- The peak time is 10 AM to 12 PM, clearly the rush hour.
- Consider staffing more during this time or having fresh stock ready to meet the demand.

🌅 **4. Sales by Daypart**

Sales are broken down into:
- Afternoon: 5,049 purchases
- Morning: 4,108 purchases
- Night and Evening contribute the least.

This insight can guide your operational hours, menu rotation, and marketing efforts depending on the time of day.

📆 **5. Weekday vs Weekend**

- Customers prefer shopping on weekdays, with 6,145 purchases compared to 3,320 on weekends.
- Think about weekday-specific offers or ways to attract more weekend traffic (e.g., family bundles or brunch menus).

🔢 **6. Frequency of Purchases by Item Count**

- Most customers buy 1 to 3 items per visit, with 2 items being the most frequent.
- Upselling opportunities exist—perhaps offer a “Buy 2, get 1 free” campaign or suggest pairings at checkout.

## 📌 Summary
- Focus on top sellers (Coffee, Bread, Tea) and frequent pairings to drive revenue.

- Peak time is late morning, especially on weekdays.

- Most customers buy just a couple of items—so small upsell nudges can make a difference.
